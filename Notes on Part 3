* Basics of Option Pricing
    Long futures contract on gold: 
        if gold goes up by $1, 1 contract leverage would get you $100.
        Always multiply by leverage
        Winning or losing depends on how future price is moving
        Linear relationship
    Options
        * Are not linear; price of contrat is not only variable
        * options are theoretically prices based on a probability model
        * factors:
            * cost of carry
            * risk free interest rate
            * the stirke price
            * volatility of price change of the underlying futures price
            * the futures price
            * time to expiration
        * dont focus on cost of carrt or risk free I.R. since they do not flucate on a day to day basis
        * theoretical price gives us estimate but we trade the option premium
        * option premium = intristinc value + extrinsic value
        * intrinsic value = what the position or option would be worth at expiration (i.e. if it were today)
        * extrinsic value = prob factor (i.e. theoretical value) + supply&demand_element
        * Examples:
            * the deeper in the money the option is, the greater the intrinsic value
                * if strike price is 75, when future is @ 80, price is mostly intrinsic
                * if strike price is 90, when future is @ 80, price is all extrinsic
            * we lose extrinsic value as time moves forward
            * higher the implied volitility (iv) the more expensive the option is (has higher price, all things being equal)
            * as time moves forward, the role of volitility diminishes as we get closer to the expiration; we get closer to the intrinsic value

* Value a Bond and Calculate Yield to Maturity
    * How do we value his bond
    * We can do simple or compound interest
    * Simple interest: coupon yield, current yield
    * Compound interest: yield to maturity
    * Simple interest: sum of value of all coupons
        * A coupon payment on a bond is a periodic interest payment that the bondholder receives during the time between when the bond is issued and when it matures.
        * If you buy the bond, hold till maturity, then value of the investment is simply the sum of all the coupon payments
        * Coupon yield = 1 years coupon payment / par value
            * Set when a bond is issued
        * Current yield = 1 years coupon payment / current price buying at
            * Problem w/ current yield: doesnt account for the amount of money you lose or gain
            when the bond matures
            * Example: if you pay $1200 for a bond that matures at $1000, you lose $200 btu this is not reflected in the current yield
    * Compound interest
        * You re-invest coupon payments into another investment, which has same interest rate as bond,
        * Some guesswork, since the reinvestment is variable
        * Coupon 2 = coupoun 1 + interest earned from coupon 1
    * Example:
        * After 30 yrs, a bond has a simple interest calculation of $1500
        * If, however, you reinvest at 5%, the bond is $3400 after 30yrs
    * Yield to Maturity
        * Accounts for par gain or loss, which i the difference in what you pay for the bond and what it matures at
        * Sum the compound interest and the par gain/loss, which gives a difference value. 
        * This is used to calculate Yield To Maturity
        * Crazy equation to do the calculation (there is a calc at zenwealth.com)
    * Example:
        * If only looking at coupon yield, can be misleading due to it not changing based on price you pay
        * Current yield is better but does not take into account maturity value nor compound interest
        * Yield to maturity gives you best look at how to price the bond

* Why a futures price differs from a forward price
    * forward contract - over the counter agreement, private transaction
        * primary risk is mainly based on counter party defaulting
    * futures contract - trades on an exchange based on rules in the contract
        * exhcnage is coutner party and therefore little risk of default by exchange
        * risk is basis risk (??)
    * why are prices different?
        * daily settlements on futures but not on forward
        * assuming positive ocrrelation with stirke price S and interest rate r
            * If price goes up, daily settlement creates excess margin which can be taken out by owner of futures, which can be reinvested at higher interest rate
            * If price goes down, daily settlement creates margin call which can be taken out by owner of futures, which can be reinvested at higher interest rate
    * summary
        IF strike price and interest rate are positively correlated, future > forward price
        IF strike price and interest rate are negative correlated, future < forward price

* What is VWAP?
    * Volume weighted average price
    * closing price of the day is average of the last 30min of transaction
    * but not simple average, need to account of volume of transaction
        * sum of volume*price of transactions / sum of volume of transactions
    * VWAP of the whole day for lesser volume stocks
    * Used for derivative pricing at end of day
    * Used for stock manipulation
        * End of month or year, they will put in large order to inflate price
