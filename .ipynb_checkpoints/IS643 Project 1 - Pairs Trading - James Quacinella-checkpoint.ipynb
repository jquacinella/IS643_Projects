      "## What is Pair Trading? \n",
      "\n",
      "Pair trading is a strategy for trading a pair financial instruments, where this pair historically has a 'mean reverting' relationship. This means that historically, the spread between the instrument's prices trade within a tight region, and if we detect that the current spread is outside its historical norm, we can take advantage of this by trading the instruments with the idea that the prices will return to their historical relationship. Essentially, we are exploiting slight deviations from a historical norm.\n",
      "\n",
      "A basic way of approaching this goes as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Generate a list of pairs that we think trade together. This list can be generated using common sense (Pepsi and Coke) or knowledge of business fundamentals.\n",
      "- Testing this list of instruments for a mean reverting historical relationship. This can be done by testing for co-integration\n",
      "- Detecting either\n",
      "  - a temporary move away from this historical mean and create a position based on this; or\n",
      "  - that the instruments are moving *back* to their historical mean and we need to cash in our profits\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most pair trading algorithms take a pair of positions \u2014 a long and a short. In this way, the trader isn\u2019t betting on direction, but rather simply betting that eventually the two assets will gravitate back to their usual relationship. Unfortunately, markets are not always predictable. Assets that were correlated over the last several years may not be correlated tomorrow. Correlations are tendencies for assets to move together, but at any given time they can diverge. This is called drift and will be talked about later.\n",

I wanted to focus on a single pair to make sure I understood what was going on, as well as for debugging purposes. The algorithms can be easily extened to loop over the stocks context variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "After testing the pair for cointegration, we start our strategy: we look to find when the spread is 'out-of-bounds' from the historical average (defined as a parameter, context.window_length) by testing if the current spread is greater than the historical mean + or - some fraction of the historical standard deviation (context.zThreshold). If so, we long one stock and short the other, and then look for when the 'mean reversion' happens to lock in some profits. We detect this when the current spread and the historical spread 'cross paths'.\n",
